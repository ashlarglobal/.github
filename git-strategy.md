# Git Strategy Practices

In our project, we follow specific branching naming conventions to maintain a structured and organized Git workflow. These practices help us effectively manage features, bugs, and hotfixes. Below are the recommended practices that we follow:

1. Use descriptive and meaningful names: Choose branch names that accurately reflect the purpose or content of the branch. This helps team members easily understand the purpose of each branch.

2. Use lowercase letters and hyphens: Stick to lowercase letters and use hyphens to separate words in branch names. This improves readability and consistency.

3. Prefix branches with a category:
   - **Feature branches**: `feature/{feature branch name}`
   - **Bug branches**: `bug/{bug name}`
   - **Hotfix branches**: `hotfix/{hotfix name}`

4. Keep branch names concise: Try to keep branch names short and concise while still conveying their purpose. Avoid excessively long branch names that can become cumbersome to work with.

5. Avoid special characters and spaces: To ensure compatibility across different systems and avoid potential issues, avoid using special characters, spaces, or non-alphanumeric characters in branch names.

## Examples

Here are some examples of branch names based on our naming conventions:

- Feature branch: `feature/add-login-page`
- Bug branch: `bug/fix-navigation-bug`
- Hotfix branch: `hotfix/update-payment-processing`

Remember, these practices are not strict rules, but rather general guidelines that can help maintain a clean and consistent branch naming convention. Feel free to adapt them based on our specific project requirements and team preferences.

By following these Git strategy practices, we aim to have a structured and efficient workflow that enables seamless collaboration and version control in our development process.




## Commit Message Guidelines

Writing clear and descriptive commit messages is essential for maintaining a well-documented Git history. Following a consistent commit message format helps in understanding the purpose and context of each commit. Here are some guidelines for writing commit messages:

1. Use the imperative mood: Start the commit message with a verb in the imperative form. For example, use "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove", etc.

2. Keep it concise: Limit the commit message to 50 characters or less. This provides a concise summary of the changes introduced in the commit.

3. Provide additional details (optional): If necessary, provide additional details in the commit message body. This can include a more comprehensive explanation of the changes, references to relevant issues or tickets, or any other relevant information.

4. Separate subject from body: If the commit message includes a body, separate the subject from the body with a blank line.

5. Use proper grammar and punctuation: Write commit messages using correct grammar and punctuation to ensure clarity and readability.

## Examples

Here are some examples of well-formatted commit messages:

- "Add login functionality"
- "Fix navigation bug"
- "Update README with installation instructions"
- "Remove deprecated code"

Remember, these are basic guidelines, and you can adapt them based on your team's preferences and project requirements. The goal is to have consistent and informative commit messages that make it easy to understand the changes made in each commit.
